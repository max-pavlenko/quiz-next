## A/B testing for CTA button color:

Objective: Determine which color (e.g., primary color vs. secondary color) of the CTA button yields better conversions. Implementation Steps:

### a. Create variations
Develop two variations of the Button component, each with a different color scheme for the CTA button. For example, one with the primary color and another with a secondary color.

### b. Random assignment

Implement a mechanism to randomly assign users to one of the variations (e.g., with Google Optimize). This ensures a fair distribution of users between the two variations.
### c. Tracking

Implement event tracking to record user interactions with the CTA button, such as clicks or conversions.
### d. Analysis

After a sufficient sample size, analyze the data to determine which color variation resulted in better user engagement.
### e. Winner implementation

Implement the color scheme that performed better as the permanent design.
